Yeah, huh

Three-somethin'-thou' for my LV feet
3.5 just to help me sleep
I'll do a bitch like Joel Embiid
She'll never, ever get a ring from me
Ho on my line like, We gotta talk, I don't know what I done, but it can't be deep
Ten whole pounds of top of the shelf, I don't know what it costs, but it can't be cheap

Huh, damn, I'm geeked
I don't think that she want me for me
Huh, damn, am I tweakin'
Or am I a little higher than y'all?
Quiet it down, I ain't lyin' to y'all
You get prioritized if it's profit involved
Tired of y'all, I ain't flyin' with y'all
I'll die 'fore I sing to the choir at all (Bitch)

Nah, I ain't going for it (Bitch)
Nah, I don't know nothin'
I just count up my deads by my lonesome
I ain't goin' in the bed 'til this ho gone
It's a hole in my chest if this ho close
Shit get cold as December with no clothes
This a V12 engine, I don't go slow
If my feet on the pedal, just hold on
Damn, huh, my baby gon' hold out for me (Hold out for me)
Damn (Damn), I been prayin' we turn out okay (We turn out okay)
Girl (Girl), why you tearin' my shirt off?
Goddamn (Shirt off, Goddamn)
Huh, you know I got— You know I got all eyes on me (You know I got all eyes—)

I don't got much left, I'm thuggin' all by myself
Huh, I know what's right, what's wrong, huh, I guess I don't got much else
Huh, let's get a lil' more high, roll me an L, put the windows down
Ridin' 'round town in that, Oh my God, where in the hell did he get that from?
Woah, when'd you get this fine?
Like, "Bitch, can I hit this time?"
I had six grams in that blunt, I ain't think I could get this high
I don't think I'ma risk this one
Uh, your team worth fifty bucks
Bitch, you really missed me, huh?
Didn't that shit feel real for once?
